It took me seven hours to write my first hugo page.

I wanted to do it in a traditional way to build a Hugo website using Terminal on my Mac, but that would take me another week to learn how to use it.

It can be a good learning opportunity, but I am overwhelmed as it is just a tiny part of my entire works.. so, I'm starting it with Forestry and Netlify.
